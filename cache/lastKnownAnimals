Just walks beautifully with her pack. Spirit is about 60lbs and 8 years old. Spirit needs good walks during the day to keep her stimulated and happy. But is a very good chill dog indoors. She is great with other dogs and loves all her humans. Spirit needs to be in a cat - free home. We are so excited to see Spirit blossom in our care. If you are intrested in adopting her please fill out the adoption application on our website. www.socialteesnyc.org \n\nthis animal is not at the Social Tees office (325 East 5TH Street) — all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If you’d like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there.

She's a year old, about 50 lbs, and came from a home where she was barely socialized -- she's jumpy around outdoor noises and can be shy in new situations, but she's super smart, very eager to trust, learns fast, and settles in well once she's had a day or two to chill out. She's great with small dogs on the calmer side but seems to be afraid of bigger dogs and pups that come at her with too much playful energy. She walks okay on a leash but could use some more time outside getting used to the sights and sounds. She's very playful, an awesome jogging partner, and a great cuddle companion indoors. Basil would do best in an active home ideally out of the city or in a quiet neighborhood where she can get a slower introduction to the wide world around her. She would get along great with another chill smaller dog for a buddy who can guide the way. Her foster dad says: \"This is our 6th time fostering. Basil was kind of a mess when I first picked her up, but she is a really quick leaner. She went from peeing the in house to only peeing outside in 2 days. She can be shy in public and startles easily, but definitely very curious and I see her warming up to other dogs, other people and the outside world pretty fast. I keep her away from dogs that are larger than her to help her confidence. She seems to be afraid of the crate as well, but we're working on that too. At home she is very playful and loving -- definitely a snuggler! She has a lot of energy which I think is normal for labs especially a 1 year old. I run with her a couple miles every day. She's a great running buddy! Doesn't pull that much. I see her as a diamond in the ruff right now. With a little TLC and training she will be a great dog.\" Interested in adopting?

Meet Triumph! (If you haven’t yet.) She is starting to grow into her name with a little help from an extra special foster family! This hound mix is about 7 months old, shy but very loving, great with other pups, fast-learning, and would thrive in an outdoorsy home ideally in the ‘burbs or country because she’s pretty jumpy around city noises and buzz. She‘s about 30 lbs and is still finding her confidence but thrives with the right guidance and environment. Her foster mom says: “Triumph is such a friendly dog! She is great with my husband and follows him around everywhere. She is very smart and is learning ‘sit.’ She is very treat and toy motivated and is not possessive of her food or any items. She loves blankets and anything soft! She will go on her back and do the cutest wiggle when shes laying on the couch. Triumph is THE best snuggler. She curls herself up in a little ball and lets you hold her until you fall asleep. She's a bit skittish outside with loud noises but we have been practicing walking outside and using positive reinforcement on our walks. She has improved even though it as only been a few days. She is not a noisy dog and can be pretty chill even though shes always down to play!”\n\nTriumph would do best in an active household, where she can grow up to be the best hound for your family EVER... if Triumph sounds like the hound pup for you -- APPLY NOW\n\nGet the latest Social Tees news by following us on Instagram (@socialteesnyc) or Facebook.
